# Plant Monitoring and Fault Detection - Masterâ€™s Course Repository

## Course Overview

The **Plant Monitoring and Fault Detection** course is a comprehensive module dedicated to introducing advanced strategies and techniques for monitoring various processes and making informed decisions. This course equips students with the knowledge to implement decision support and operator training systems effectively, with a strong focus on data management, statistical process monitoring, and fault detection.

In this course, students will engage in numerous activities and lab sessions, applying the learned theories and methods to real-world scenarios such as wind power generation systems, electrical energy transmission, and wastewater treatment plants. Special emphasis is placed on the application of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) and model-based fault diagnostics methods across diverse structures and systems.
